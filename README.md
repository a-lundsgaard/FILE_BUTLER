# FileButler

Completely responsive webapp using a mobile-first approach. 

Demo: https://filebutler.vercel.app

Unit tests and a new logo need to be added in the future.

## Features

Features includes working with files e.g. merging PDF files and extracting text from images. 

## Stack

Developed using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypesScript and Vercel for deployment.

## Backend
The webapp consumes a REST-api developed using TypeScript and the MVC-pattern. The API uses Docker and Heroku for DevOps. The code for this API can be seen under the [FileButler-API](https://github.com/a-lundsgaard/FileButler-API) repo.
